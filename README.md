DEMO GAMES USING PURR DATA AND GEM LIBRARY

The whole idea of this repository is to create some demo games in purr data while using GEM Library, the idea being showing the full capanilities of this visual programing language in making games.
For now its work in progress on the main repository page outside of any folder are my practise patches and some pacthes that I wrote once that will be used again and again like collider and random location spawner and a patch to move from point A to B.
In the folder I have created the dmeo games I am working on it includes the Art folder the sound folder(containing WAV files) and off course the PD patch.

Feel free to reach out if you have some amaing idea of how things can be improved or anything that can be optimied.
